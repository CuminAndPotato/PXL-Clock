Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned developer or new to programming, we hope these resources will jumpstart your creativity.

You can use this repository as a reference point for developing your own custom PXL-Clock applications. We provide examples, documentation, and tools to help you get started:

To programm PXL-Apps, you need to set up your development environment. Here‚Äôs how to get started:

### Prerequisites

- [**.NET 8 SDK**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [**Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [**Ionide-fsharp Extension for VSCode**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ionide.Ionide-fsharp)

### Fork the Repository

Best practice is to fork this repository to your GitHub account. This way, you can experiment with the code and save your changes, and maybe there will be some surprises along the way. üéÅ

### Create Your First App

A PXL-App consists of two parts:

- one or more F# script (or many of them) that contain the code for your app,
- optionally some assets like images.

To set up your first app, simply create a new F# script file in the `./apps_fsharp` directory. You can use the existing apps as a starting point to learn more about the structure of a PXL-App.

### üöÄ Start the Simulator

TL;DR: 

- Open the VSCode build task (by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+B`) and select `Start All`. That will run the simulator and the FSI (F# Interactive) file watcher for you.
- You then open the simulator in your browser (`http://localhost:5001`).
- After that, simple create or modify and `.fsx` file in the `./apps_fsharp` directory.
- The last file saved will be automatically run in the simulator.

### Submit Your App

When you‚Äôre ready to submit your app, create a pull request (PR) with your changes. We‚Äôll review your app, provide feedback or merge it.

Follow-up PRs (updates) for your app in case you want to improve it are welcome!

### The PizzaMampf Sprite

Check out the sprite üñºÔ∏è `./apps_fsharp/03_ Demos/assets/pizzaMampf.png`) and swap them with your own custom artwork to personalize your app.

### Deploying an App or an Image to the PXL-Clock

Here are 2 ways of deploying an app or an image to the PXL-Clock. Keep in mind that
- the PXL-Clock needs to be connected to the same network as your computer.
- the artifacts you deploy are not persistent (for now) and will be lost after a reboot.

There are two ways to deploy an app or an image to the PXL-Clock:

**Using the VSCode Build Tasks**

Open the list of build tasks in VSCode:
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+B` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+B` (macOS).
- Select **Deploy App** or **Deploy Image** from the list.

**Using the Scripts Directly**

In your terminal, run the following scripts:
- `./deploy-app.sh` (Mac) or `./deploy-app.ps1` (Windows) to deploy an app.
- `./deploy-image.sh` (Mac) or `./deploy-image.ps1` (Windows) to deploy an image.
